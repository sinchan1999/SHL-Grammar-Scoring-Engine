 My favorite place is my favorite place is Utti and Kodai Kanal, my experience by traveling for the Utti and Kodai Kanal is very good. I travel to the Utti and Kodai Kanal through others with my family and friends. I enjoyed a lot in the Utti and Kodai Kanal. The local foods in the Utti and Kodai Kanal are chocolates which which were very sweeter than the honey, experienced it doing very good many times, yeah, there is a particular time of day or season when this place is magic full in the month of January February or December also we have a very rich number of games during the night times in the old tea. It is a very beautiful place one can visit.
