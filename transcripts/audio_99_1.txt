 Seeing at an airport is generally chaotic. Once you enter the airport near the gate, you will have a lot of cars and rickshaws just lined up either onboarding passengers that are getting out of the airport or seeing off passengers that are going into the airport. airport when you get into the airport there are check-in counters for different flight companies where there are staff members and receptionists ready to welcome you then check your baggage and make sure you have the correct baggage weight and then you go up the escalator and then you are at the food court or you wait at the lobby where you can have some food get some drinks get get some water and then you check in with your tickets.
