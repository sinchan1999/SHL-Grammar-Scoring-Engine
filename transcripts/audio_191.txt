 My favorite place to visit is Tirupati, so it has most, while traveling to this place there are many, there are many places to see that it mostly concepts about the beautiful nature and in this place many countries and many religions are combined there, their local food. The most food that I like in these places is that food which is given in the temple. In the any season it this place was most beautiful because in the any season most of the plants will grow on the nature looks like very beautiful.
