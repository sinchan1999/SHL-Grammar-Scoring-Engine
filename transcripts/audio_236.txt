 Describe the scene of a school on playground. We are checking that there are many kids playing as well as there are many teachers paying attention to what the students are doing. For example, they are checking that they are playing in a good way, having fun or competing but not being bullied or having any issues about confrontations. We see that the weather is really nice and there are good interactions among the students. We can see that they get along with each other really good.
