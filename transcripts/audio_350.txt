 My favorite holiday destination would be Malaysia because there is a nice place, delicious and friendly people. It is famous for the KLCC high building. It is very high and awesome. Since my hobby is taking photographs, so there is a good place to practice boosting and enhance my skills. There is not only KLCC but also famous for their delicious food such as kachang, satay. It is a small dish and very useful for Malaysians. It is made of chicken, beef, rabbit and etc. It will serve with rice and sauce. The sauce is a delicious sauce to dip and very secret recipe.
