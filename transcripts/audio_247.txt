 My favorite place to visit is Srinagar because it was in the top of the North India. My journey could be like this. I am going by train to Jammu. After that we are going to have a car by which we reach Srinagar. By using Kair, we are able to see the natural beauty of the Jammu and Kashmir which is very excited to see. It looks like a heaven. The local food which is famous in that place was Rajma Chawal during the road trip and there are mushrooms as well which is special. favorite season or a particular time in which we are able to go to Srinagar was in winters when the snowfall is going to begin because it looks very beautiful in that
