 I will describe it as placing in general. The place was well managed with a great attention to detail. Staff had clear instructions and they act accordingly. Of course I couldn't help the manager inside me and notice some areas for improvement. For example, during breakfast I will assign more people to the dining room, since many times the staff didn't manage to replace the perfect tables. Or I will change the ratio of the automatic lights or the corridors, since for all other people they simply switch off too quickly.
