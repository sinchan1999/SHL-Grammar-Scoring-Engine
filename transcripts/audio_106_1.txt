 The best day of my life would definitely be when I went to the museum with my family. For me, it was one of the best days because it was such a nice time. It was my first time at the museum and always my breath was taken away by the architecture, the art itself, and where it's located. It's a beautiful location and it brought me so much peace. It really helped me throughout the days because I felt happiness even because of me being there and with the people I most love and getting matcha. And the air was just so crisp and beautiful. The weather was spectacular. There was nothing wrong with that day. And I wanted to go eat dinner. and a really nice restaurant, so even though it's a very simple date, I really loved it.
