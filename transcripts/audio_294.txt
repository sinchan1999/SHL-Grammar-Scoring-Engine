 I actually believe that the best day of my life is every day and I think that today was also one of my best days because I think I had Pao Bhaji today that my mother made on my demand and I was able to complete my trap insta test without any problems and I was able to complete it with my own abilities and I had my friend called over here, Shivam. He also helped me out in the test. He was giving his own test and I had fun with him actually and we played lots of games today and today was my fun day because I actually encountered a very vicious animal that I don't like that is lizard but my friend Shivam actually helped me in getting that lizard out of my house and that was very amazing. We were very amazed by it.
