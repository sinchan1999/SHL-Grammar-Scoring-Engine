 The market looks pretty crowded when you get there and even though it's not fully packed, there's still quite a lot of chatter and there's people everywhere looking at the veggies and fruit stands, there's like cheese stands and also people offering tastings of different wines and chocolates. There's even stands of international foods like Spanish and Mexican. There's even a stand for alcoholic beverages and other types of drinks. So even though it's nice and quiet in the mornings, at night times it can get pretty, pretty loud with all the parties and laughter.
