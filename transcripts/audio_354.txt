 My goal in life is to save the planet. There is a serious need that we, human beings, we need to save our Earth because we are facing a serious crisis of climate change. There is flood, there is everything so. My goal is to educate my community on how we can recycle, on how we can change what we do things, and on how we can make our planet a better place for our future children. They have to enjoy what we have enjoyed. They have to see what we have seen. Animals are being scattered. Everything they see is dirty. Everywhere is dirty. So we have to change the way we do things. We have to do things to better our future. ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
