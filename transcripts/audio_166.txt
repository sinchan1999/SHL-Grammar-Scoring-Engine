 well I went to New York and I was going to in the evening there was my favorite band or one of my three favorite bands was playing in Brooklyn so I was going to that and in the morning I got an ad on Facebook advertising the Book of Mormon the musical which I I really wanted to see but I don't know I had like totally forgotten about it by the time I actually was in New York since it came out a a few years before and yeah I ended up getting a ticket so went around New York ate a bunch of great food like New York pizza bagel and yeah I went to see the Book of Mormon then I walked around some more I looked at the UN went to see my favorite band took the ferry back to Staten Island and while eating like a Baconator out on the ferry looking at Manhattan the night and set your liberty. Yeah, it was great
