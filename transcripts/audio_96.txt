 Greetings. I am about to describe my favorite hobby. My hobby is to read books. What is the thing that I enjoy most about my hobby is because when reading books it gives you a peace of mind and it also gives you a lot of knowledge. You can learn a lot of vocabulary from what you learn and you can also use it in your daily life. There are certain tools that I use in order to read. For example, I have a lot of books from which I most commonly read, but I also use the phones and laptops in order to read because there are many free apps and also paid apps in order to provide you books. I enjoy practicing the hobby on my own because reading alone is a kind of a piece and it is also very soothing. But I also suggest others to read a lot of books because it can greatly improve their vocabulary and it also can help them to improve themselves.
