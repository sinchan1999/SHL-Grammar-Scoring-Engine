 Okay, so my role model is someone like my mother. She is a very responsible person that basically always has something to do when there is duty that needs to be done. She undertakes that occupation, that duty, and even if that means leaving behind something that you want to So basically, the thing that needs to be done takes priority over the things that you actually want or wish to do. And that will be it.
