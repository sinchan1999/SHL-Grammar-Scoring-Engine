 Okay, I went to leave some lunch for my baby during their break on school and they were all playing on the playground. There were a huge field where there was grass on it. Some kids had their own toys playing all around. Another of them were hiding, the game is called hide which one kid just hides and the rest of the kids have to find each other and say here it is and it was it was actually pretty fun it was pretty good to see him involving in this environment
