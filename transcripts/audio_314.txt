 well my stay at a resort first would be like the breakfast I would have like a lot of fruits because you can eat whatever you want and I really love fruits and then I would go to the pool all day like to relax and play with my family then for lunch I would maybe take a shower maybe not and eat some pasta I think then that evening I would spend my time relaxing and taking a shower to get ready for dinner because some resorts have like special restaurants with different type of food and I always think it's interesting to go to them and eat the food.
