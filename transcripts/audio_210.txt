 On every Sunday near my house there is a crowded market because in that market they sell vegetables, meat, fish and chicken. In the crowded market it is very difficult to carry anything or by walk also we are not able to walk in some time because there is a lot of crowd and no one cares about one another person in that crowd every individual have their own task to complete in the market so they only prefer themselves not others
