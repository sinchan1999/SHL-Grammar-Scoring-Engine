 A playground has a lot of equipment. It typically has things like a swing set, a seesaw, monkey bars, a play set with stairs and maybe a slide, as well as a sandbox. Obviously, there are usually a lot of kids around a playground. The ground itself might have sand, grass, mulch, rubber or a mix of all of them. It might be a school, so there might be teachers watching the kids, or it might be a park where there are parents watching the kids. There's usually a variety of activities to do depending on the age of the kids. For example, there's some equipment that is pretty low to the ground for kids who just have just started walking, and sometimes there are activities with steps and taller slides for the older children.
