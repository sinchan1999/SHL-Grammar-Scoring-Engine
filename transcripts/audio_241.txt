I like cricket because I like to pick cricket and I like to watch cricket. So there is a bat and a ball. So there is a batsman and a baller. baller so I like when when a batsman hit a six and I like cricket because so whenever I go in the ground I feel like I'm a batsman and again so cricket is most most
