 If I think of a flood, I would be thinking of a lot of houses underwater, maybe a lot of people trying to swim, to cross the different streets, dogs, trying to follow their owners. Also imagine a lot of cars underwater, people trying to ask for help on their roofs, and a lot of fish swimming on the streets. I also picture different government agencies trying to help.
