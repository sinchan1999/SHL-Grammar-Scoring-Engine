 Basketball is my favorite sport. I like how it involves teamwork between the players and it feels good whenever I make a shot. Also I'd like or I like how the pressure it gives whenever we are competing with the opponent especially when the time is running out and the score is almost tied. It feels good when when the team wins but it also feels good when we lose but we still or we are using that as our motivation to be better in the next games
