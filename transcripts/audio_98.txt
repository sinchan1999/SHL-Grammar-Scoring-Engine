 I went to Santa in Guatemala and I enjoyed this day at the resort since they were all inclusive. I ate a lot, I drank a lot of different drinks, I swam, I went to the sea. I really enjoyed going to the beach since it is one of my favorite places in the world. It was all amazing and people was enjoying the time there. I will always remember that vacation. I would like to repeat it again and going with my family. Staying at one of the best resorts in Guatemala was an amazing experience. It was wonderful.
