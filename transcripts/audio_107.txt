 My favorite place to visit is the beach. I love the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. The feeling of the sand between my toys and the small smell of the salt water. I love the fact that there is always something to do at the beach. I can swim, sun bath, build sandcastle or just relax and listen to the waves. One of my favorite things to do at the beach is the collect seashells. I love the different shapes, size and colors of seashells. I also like to try to find seashells that has been washed on the shore by the waves. Another favorite thing to do the beach is to watch the sunset. I love the way sky turns to different colors as the sun goes. It is a very peaceful and relaxing experience. I am also enjoying walks on the beach.
