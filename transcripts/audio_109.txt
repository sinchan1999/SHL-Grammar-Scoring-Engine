 My favourite place to visit is La Basna, that is Lal Bahadur Sastri National Academy of Administration, which is situated in Mussoori. This is my favourite place because the civil servants who cleared UPSC may be attending the La Basna. This is the place where civil servants, which is the aspirants who cleared IAS, they will be training in that academy. That is the favourite place not only for me but for the candidates who practice civil services and it is situated in Musori and it is the best place for the IAS officers. Moreover, the best season to visit Mussoori is rainy season, winter season because Mussoori which is located near to Himalayas where it is covered with snow, it is a heavenly place.
