 Last week, I went to a beautiful resort by the beach. The weather was really nice and the breeze was amazing. And if I talk about the food, the food was also very good. We also got to do many activities over there like scuba diving. We also did snorkeling. We had an amazing experience spending the night in the resort and doing all the adventures with it. It was an amazing and a beautiful time that me and my family spent at the resort. And the food, they had varieties of food over there. They had Italian, they had Chinese, they had Asian, they had multi cuisine over there and the time, the food, the place, everything was amazing.
