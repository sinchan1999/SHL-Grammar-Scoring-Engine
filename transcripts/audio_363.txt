 My biggest hobby is about riding a motorbike, and to ride a motorbike, I obviously need motorbike, and I have to... the motorbike needs to be taxed and emoted, and I need fuel and good weather and I like riding on my own possibly but when I go on my own it's just a short ride but when I go with others I can just follow them and they know great roads so I just follow and it can take all day.
