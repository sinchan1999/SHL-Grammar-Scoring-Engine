 Friendship is one of the greatest blessings that not everyone is lucky to have enough. We met a lot of people in the journey of life, but there are only few leave a mark on us. My best friend is one such person who has been able to make a positive impact on my life. if we have been a part of each other's lives for the longest time and our friendship is still developing. She has been with me through all the sticks and tints. Most importantly, I feel fortunate to have someone at my best friend.
