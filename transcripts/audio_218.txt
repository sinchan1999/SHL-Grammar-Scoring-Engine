 When you go to a wet market or to the market, you'll usually see two sections, the wet section and the dry section. Now normally, I personally do not like going to the wet section of the market because as it's mentioned, it's wet. But normally that's where the crowd is at, especially during the mornings, you'll see all the mothers, all the families, some even bringing their children with them buying meat, because it's the best time to buy meat.
