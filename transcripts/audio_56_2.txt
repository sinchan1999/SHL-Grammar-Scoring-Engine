 There's a crowded market, kind of a variety of various dicknacks and electronics, magazines and books and things like that, almost like a flea market on the perimeter. That's those are the sort of items you see alongside various snacks. There's lots of people chattering, you hear some bargaining around you, and as you get closer to the interior, you see the core of the market, it's mostly food. Regular people could shop there, but it's a lot of restaurant things like whole fish, sides of beef, things like that. You see a great amount, a variety of vegetables, everything sold, you know, mostly intended to be sold in large quantities. This is the reason for that.
