 My favourite holiday destination would be Goa because Goa is one of the best place and cheapest place where we can travel, most of the people travel and where we have so many beaches where we can relax ourselves and we can feel very pleasant there. So Goa is one of the best, I want to have a beautiful, chill out place where we can easily chill out there and it is one of the best favorite holiday destination that I have. Goa is one of the small state but it has very huge number of places where we can explore in it.
