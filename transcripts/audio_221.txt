 I consider the best day of my life to be when I went on a trip to a tropical paradise. A morning started early with birds shivering and waves crashing against the shore and the sun shining through the window. I spent the day lounging on the beach, relaxing under the sun and swimming in a crystal clear water. evening I watched the sunset from a rooftop bar while sipping on a fresh refreshing cold drink. It was a completely carefree day filled with relaxation and enjoyment and I would like to visit there once again. Another best day of my life manifested a new state there. It was filled with excitement. I explored the streets, tried new foods, immersed myself in the new culture. So all the traveling days were being the best day of my life. Thank you.
