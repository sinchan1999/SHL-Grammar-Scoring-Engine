 I was visited to one of the largest crowded market in a new deli where I go to buy a product for my wife like clothes and everything for their stuff so over there we are purchasing all this stuff but there are so much crowd on that day it's a sunday and weekend that's So we came to know that on Sunday and Saturdays it have lots of crowded over here and we have to make sure that we can go in weekends rather than the Saturday and Sunday. So over there if you come to the weekdays you will receive less crowd.
