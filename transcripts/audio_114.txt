 Hey people, so now we are on the scene of the flood that happened yesterday. So we can see on the scene that there are a lot of cars that are under the water. We can see a lot of mud. We can see a lot of people that lost their things. So if you want to help these people that lost all their stuff, please feel free to reach me out so we can deposit them some money and if you are seeing this message and you have family with these issues please also reach me out so we can get as ecologists.
