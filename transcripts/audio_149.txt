 The airport is buzzing with activity as people scurry around, lugging suitcases, looking at departure boards. The sound of announcement over the intercom fills the air as travelers wait in long lines to check in and pass through security. The smell of coffee and food fills the air as people grab a quick bite to eat before their flight. Families with children run around excitedly looking at the planes through the endless windows. Flight crews rush through the terminal, pulling their wheelie suitcase behind them.
