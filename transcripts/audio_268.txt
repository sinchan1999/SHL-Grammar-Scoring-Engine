 My favorite holiday destination is Tagaytay City. Tagaytay is actually my solitude place where I can relax my mind and enjoy the scenery of detail volcano. So every time that I have my paid time off and holiday season I make sure that the family is booked a staycation in this area so that I can enjoy the holiday season with my family as well as enjoy the perfect scenery in this location.
