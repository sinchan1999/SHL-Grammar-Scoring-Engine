 My school playground is very big. It's very huge. There are trees at the boundaries. All the trees cover the edges of the playground. And there were children approximately 30 to 40 who play daily in the playground. I heard birds chirping, water falling from the water cooler. And the wind touches the leaves of the tree, and the tree leaves dances them. The birds play with the tree leaves. They make their nest on the tree. The school children playing cricket. And on the other side, some children playing football. Football is a popular game between children nowadays. It can be seen playing by the children in maximum playgrounds of the school.
