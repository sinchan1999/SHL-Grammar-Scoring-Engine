 My school playground when the bell rang is very enthusiastic and very ever memorable to see playground. My school playground was a peak and a square covered with a large boundary wall and it will be divided into three sets with the tennis one, one for playing tennis and another for football and volleyball. There are many trees in down there in the pios to ensure that we can reach out to take rest between the interval time of the school and there are at the corner there are three rooms.
