 I truly want to have one life goal, and that is not to die poor, while people may say that money does not buy happiness, or cannot buy happiness, money can, essentially, buy, or at the very least take care of a lot of life's issues, and set issues with being down your happiness. As such, I made it my goal in life to essentially accumulate as much wealth as possible. I know you for myself also for my family, the thought of going old and yet be dependent on government programs as such forest me, let all for my family, whom I cannot say are very dependable, as such I will try my best in order to accumulate wealth, take care of all of us, throughout our ages, up until our, hopefully, time of demise.
