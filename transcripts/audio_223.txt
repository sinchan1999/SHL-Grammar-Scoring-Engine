 For me to describe my best day of my life is going to meet my family, my friends, my children. Because I have two mothers and two fathers, so we will be celebrating our best days at the picnic. So all of my family will be there, help together, we will celebrate our best day of my life together. so we will also bring cakes, ice cream, and we will also bring some friends and family that we have not met for so long so we can get together and talk about the things that we'd never talk about.
