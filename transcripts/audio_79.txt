 The playing ground that I'm thinking about is a lovely, lovely place. All around the place you can see different activities in which the kids can participate. You can see some slides, you can see kids playing on a jumping rope, there are many, many, many trees around that kids can climb on. From what I notice kids absolutely love climbing the trees. It looks like it can be the most popular thing to do in that. You can hear kids laughing, you can hear the parents trying to catch the kids and ask them to go home. Unfortunately the kids are not very happy to go home. You can hear the laughter and the vibe is just amazing.
