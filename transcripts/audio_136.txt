 Well, when I stay at a resort, what I like to do, it's always be on the pool early in the morning. I love to swim at the pool on a resort and also I love to be at a resort because, you know, you can wear shorts, you can feel the environment, all the nature there. It's a great experience and I go to a resort on every single vacation. It's simply awesome.
