 We went to our resort and there were many rooms, food, and beautiful places. We liked the pool and the friendly people who attended us that day. I remember the day was special for us because it was my birthday and the resort gave me a cake with a candle in it. I remember the color of my bikini day. I use that day in the resort and I recommend that resort because it's beautiful, clean, and easy to look for an Airbnb. I come back again. Yes, that was a beautiful resort.
