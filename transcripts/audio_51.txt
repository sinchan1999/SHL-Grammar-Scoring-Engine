 The school playground is full of happy, excited kids. Some play running after the ball, others are playing tags, trying not to get caught. Some kids are swinging high while others are jumping the rope. The place is full of laughter and fun. The school playground buzzes with life and energy. run across the grassy field. They are laughter and shouts filling the air. A group player scores, nearby a cluster of kids. The playground is a vibrant mix of color and movement. And Enjoy.
