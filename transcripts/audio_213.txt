 My favorite place to visit is the ocean. I live in a landlocked state so it takes a lot of time and effort to get to the ocean. I really have to set aside time once a year so I can visit this favorite place of mine. I love to eat seafood. It's one of my favorites, so I really take advantage of being in the location to enjoy seafood. I can't really choose the season I go since I have to coordinate around when I can have vacation, which is usually around the spring or summertime. and I really just love the ocean because it's very freeing to be there and I feel like I can really relax.
