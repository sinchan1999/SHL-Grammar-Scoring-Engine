 my stay at a resort it was unbelievable the first time that I was staying at a resort it was the Cameron Salinitas and we had these VIP passes where you can go anywhere with anyone that you'd like and you have buffet you have unlimited drinks it was an unbelievable experience the the time that I went there I was 18 years old and it was unbelievable because I went with my sister, my brother, my father, and also with my grandmother. We had a great time and it was an unbelievable time with them because I had to spend time with my family, which I don't have the time.
