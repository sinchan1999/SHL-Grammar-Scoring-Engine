 But my goal is to get somewhere, get in some big company with a good position and this is what is very important for me because of my family they trust me a lot and I also put a lot of efforts and I'm focused on it and I know I faced some challenges like right now it's so much recession in the market so no one's really hiring right now so it's gonna be a tough one and I would just like to be focused and determined by just studying daily and marking my goals that's it
