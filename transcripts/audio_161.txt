 On the last weekend I went to my family to the Kukku Resort, I enjoyed that experience because it was a beautiful resort, even if we have in the front of us the sea, we have like a pool because I feel afraid to be on the sea so I enjoyed it to be on the pool. In the meantime, we have unlimited food on the bar station. It was beautiful because of us enjoying the time with my family, eating all of the food that I can. Even you have a lot of samakas and I love to be on the samakas, even if I was with my family.
