 My goal in life is to be the best version of myself. By the best version, I mean the most healthiest version. So that means kind of being on a strict diet, low sugar, low carb, just overall trying to eat healthy. you know no sugary drinks drink water instead water and tea get a lot of sleep plenty of sleep take care of my body by exercising at least three times a week stay away from anything that'll hold me back so no smoking no drinking basically just overall just protecting myself so I can live long and help you a happy life that is my overall goal right now
