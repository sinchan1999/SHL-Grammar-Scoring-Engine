 I recently went to Bulacan. It's located in the Philippines and it's considered a province. And it was kind of a far from the usual city skylines I see here in the urban place where I live in. I grew up in Montindupa and being or visiting Bulacan was actually a kind of refreshing moment for me because I get to see other places that I don't usually see and there are lots of trees and minimal mulls and sightings that I usually see in the city.
