 A flood happens when there is too much water. This can come from heavy rain, rivers, overflowing or big waves from the sea. The waters cover the land, roads and houses and this is very dangerous. It can be super risky because it can wash anything and make it hard to get safe places. And also people in animals need to find higher ground to stay safe during a flood and that's super risky for me.
