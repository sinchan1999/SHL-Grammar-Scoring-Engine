 My favorite sport is called basketball. So I learned this sport when I was in elementary at my third day academy. I remember when the first time I held the ball. It seems like that it is one of my dreams to become a basketball player since I held that ball in my hand. I continue playing up until college but right now I don't have any spare time to play the game that I love and that's the story of the basketball for me.
