 Well, what I can describe the scene of a flood is there are lots of people who are homeless There are lots of people who doesn't have any shelter Cars that are torn up houses that are being broken down into pieces and Also schools are being suspended due to higher water and also what I can see on my flood there are lots of boats and man-made boats as well so that people can cross from a different place to another and what I also can see in flood There are lots of mud Trash there are lots of people who doesn't have anything to eat Due to the high water and at the same time some were dead on the
