 The school playground is a space where children engage in organized games with pre-existing rules and procedures, as well as improvising games created in the movement. It is an important setting for children to develop social behaviors, physical activity, and thinking skills. Children mobilize and constrain their own game participation by proposing and negotiating rules influencing the participation of others. Recreation activities during school recess can contribute to a child's recommended physical activity participation. These periods may occur in the playground and children may tell on each other which is the cause of concern for teachers and children. The school playground can promote physical activity for large number of children. Overall, the school playground is a crucial setting.
