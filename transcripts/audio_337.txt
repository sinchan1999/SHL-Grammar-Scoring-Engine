 My stay at the resort was really nice, it was really good, it was an all-included resort. The food was really amazing, really tasty. The services included customer service at the room, all included food, including breakfast, lunch and dinner, and I could use the pool, so it was a really amazing experience. the customer service was really fast and they were really kind to me. They were really friendly and I did have a really amazing time there.
