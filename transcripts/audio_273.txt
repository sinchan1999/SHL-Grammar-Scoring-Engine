 My topic about pot makes this day special, every day is normal day but this day was somewhat special because of I travelled with my friend from Tirpati to Anandapur and went to her house and by walk from railway station and that was a good pot in this day. because we talked about many things and about what we done in the Tirupati and what we not visit in Tirupati also but next time we will go Tirupati and we visit all that and in the early morning at 6 am I walked with my friend that was my very beautiful thing in this day and my brother and sister came to my home to my home. That was also special. We discussed so many things in this day. Thank you.
