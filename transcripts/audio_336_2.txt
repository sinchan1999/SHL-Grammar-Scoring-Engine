 well what I can what I can describe of a school playground could be medikits playing around with a lot of toys that are given from the school I can see also lots of sport that they can play like volleyball basketball or even football that is the one of the most popular sport that it's here in group. I think that the enjoyment in this place is kind of interesting because kids tend to play a lot and not care a lot about the school but they really like this place.
