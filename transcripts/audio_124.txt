 As a kid, I remember being part of a group that had the fortune to have a school playing out back in my first stages. I remember that we went there to play with all the games we had available under the support of our t-shirt because we had to have their supervision in order to verify that no one got hurt in this process. However, it was pretty colorful, there was a lot of kids, a lot of fun, we had balls to play there, we also have some specific games that are not common in other parks and I really enjoyed my time while being part of that school.
