 There were many children who placed, there were three trees because it was a rural place, it was made of deer, then the warmen came and was able to fix it, but there were many children or teacher played with us, there were many swims, on the swims I played with my brother signs, my brother studied everything with me, with my coaching too and well there were a lot of sales and we have a lot of soft drinks. There was a patio where we could play.
