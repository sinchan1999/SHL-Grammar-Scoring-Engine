 I was in a crowded market. There is vendors everywhere. They're selling fruits, vegetables, they sell dry goods. I'm actually not decided where will I buy. So there's a lot of vendors, there's a lot of people in the crowded market since it's crowded. there's a lot of goods where you can choose to buy, so there's fish, there's meat, there's vegetables, there's a lot in here like dry goods where there's a variety of choices where you can interesting.
