 My favorite place to visit is our province which is Bicol and I love Chablee. I love going to Bicol because there's a local foods or dishes which I love to eat there. I can eat seafoods there that we can get from a sea. And we used to travel or to go to our province which is people when it's holy week. So where our whole family is gathering our holy week or spend our holy week to our province and we bond and we celebrate or spend the holy week together with our whole family.
