 So my goal in life is just to help people as best as I can and just try to make the world a better place. The challenges that I would have to face are just making sure that I do a really good job when it comes to helping other people because helping other people can be a difficult challenge. especially since a lot of, well, some people deal with issues that take a lot of work to overcome. And the thing that motivates me to stay focused and determined, I would have to just say is seeing other people do really well and overcome challenges in life and do better in life. So I'd have to say that's what really motivates me in regards to helping other people, and just making the world a better place in general, just making sure that the world is better.
