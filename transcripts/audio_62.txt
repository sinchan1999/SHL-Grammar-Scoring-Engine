 My favorite place to visit is Tokyo and it is one of the best towns in Japan. Tokyo is such a huge city and there I would like to eat their local dishes like sushi, ramen etc. And I would love to see Tokyo after the sunset which is very beautiful and I would like to see their local cars, cars on the roads because in Tokyo there are, there are, we can see so many racing cars on the roads and the nightlife of Tokyo is very exciting and the cars, the food, breathing. Breathing is exciting.
