 My favorite place to visit is my home, my hometown, where I was born. Because since childhood I was far from my home to study, that's why my favorite place is my home. And I love everything about my home. And I was so excited when I want to go home. I love my parents, though happiness I get in my home was insane, I can't describe this. This is the best moment of my life when I was at my home. So, my favorite place is to rent my home. That's it.
