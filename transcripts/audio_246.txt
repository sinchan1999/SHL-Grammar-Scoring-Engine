 So, my stay at a resort is a stay in a resort at the beach, so I love to explore the beach, I love the water, I love nature and also the stay, the resort that I'm in also has a lot of animals surrounding like monkeys and it has a lot of pools, also it is an all-inclusive resort so I have access to food and drinks whenever I want and I have delicious meals three times a day in the official restaurant. So I also have a bedroom that has a beautiful view to the beach and I can see the sunset from it.
