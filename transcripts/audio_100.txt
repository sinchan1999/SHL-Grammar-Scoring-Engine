 Last time I was in Baru, I remember I went to the hotel at the Cameroon Resort, pretty amusing being honest, the looks of the sightseeing, the sea, the nights, also, for me, the food was a little bit expensive, but I liked it and sometimes people could be annoying as well. but in general experience I like it but the way to get there or got there I don't really like it because I got I got sick by the food but you see food anyway but in most of the time I like it
