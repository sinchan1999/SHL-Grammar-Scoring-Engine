 My favorite hobby is doing yoga. I enjoy the fact that it's very peaceful and it allows you to meditate for a while, also that your body feels really good afterwards, like you just had a massage. You need a mat to practice this hobby and I enjoy practicing it with other people in outdoor classes or indoor classes. I usually do it in the evenings because it's easier for me and I'm free at that time. It's really good for your health and it's good for when you're older and all your joints hurt. It's trying to prevent your bones and your joints hurting during your 50s or 60s.
