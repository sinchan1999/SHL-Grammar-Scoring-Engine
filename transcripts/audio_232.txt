 It is another busy Monday at Seoul Station. There are office workers with briefcase running late for work, and students with backpacks running to catch the train. There are also homeless people lying on the bench on the platform while waiting for the train to pass. There are also people selling food and drinks on the platform, and there are also a few vending machines that people can use to buy something they need.
