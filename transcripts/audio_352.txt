 okay so um my hobby is music singing and dancing but I don't really know how to dance a lot but then I love to sing um I could play um not really I don't really know how to play But then, this will give me sound systems, and I will enjoy it very, very much. So I love music. I love music. And I can just listen to my own and practice. I don't really need anyone to help me practice. I can fit on my own to my music. And I can also go to shows if I go to where people are crowded And with the original performance, single-sing it, I enjoy it a lot.
