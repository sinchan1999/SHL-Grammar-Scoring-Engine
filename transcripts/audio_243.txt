 My favourite place is Tirupati. I used to travel in train to reach the Tirupati from my boarding point. And the journey is very awesome and also I enjoyed a lot in that journey. The local food of Tirupati is alike Kovar air and one thing special about Tirupati is the hundi of Tirupati temple. I think the budget will be high in Tirupati hundi only rather than in the India's budget budget because most people are believing that the tilputi temple is very aesthetic and also powerful god and the season means there is no particular time or a special time to visit the temple
