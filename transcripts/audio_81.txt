 Hello this is Sona. Today I will describe about the one of the smartphone application that I use the most. The application of the smartphone which I use the most is probably a Facebook because it helps me with daily life events happening on our society. Whenever I open a Facebook, most of the videos which I see there are from our society only. So most of the time Facebook keeps me aligned with the nature of the people, what's going on in today's life, on environment, on news, on political parties and everything is shown on a video. So most of the time I use Facebook and in Facebook I can also search from the certain videos if I need it. So that's all. Thank you.
