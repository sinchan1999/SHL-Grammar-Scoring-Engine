 My favorite place to visit is parks, national parks. I usually take a public transport to get there and there is some walking involved. The reason I really like the parks is it gets me to walk. I can jog there to the running there and get some fresh air. and usually the parks around the parks there are local foods or multicultural food. I love trying different foods from different countries so there are lovely cafes. I go to the parks where there is local cafes there. I like to try local food cafes. Normally I go around a spring and summer. Another season is that's really magical and beautiful is during autumn when the 3 colors change when the leaves changes to yellow or reddish color that's when it looks really magical
