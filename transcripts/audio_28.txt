 Well, one of my calling life is to make more music. I already released one song, but it's not enough because I have written a lot of songs and I feel it's a death for my soul. I should really do it. I feel I would feel bad if I die and I haven't released all my songs. I feel I have my song on the placard, wardrobe. I need to pull that science here to the world. So it's really important for me to get discipline, to trust in me, and to be in contact with other musicians. I believe I know that it's a difficult career, that nobody tries harder because it's not giving money, many people give up, but it's a talent that they have, it's a gift, so I think I need to use it. Every person in this world, they have a gift, and if they don't use it, it's like the life Has a lack of sense
