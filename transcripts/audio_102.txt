 My favorite place to visit is Puerto Rico, this place is very peaceful, I had to travel from USA like New York and I need to take my plane to Puerto Rico to San Juan but there is like an island near Skokulebra and it's very very very small but with lots of beaches and places to go and eat food. The winter season is the most peaceful and beautiful.
