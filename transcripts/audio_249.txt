 The smartphone application that I use the most is Facebook and we all know that Facebook is a social media app that really captured your attention. Maybe it had a user friendly interface with a vibrant feed where you could easily scroll through posts from friends and family. You probably enjoyed sharing updates, photos, and memories while connecting with others through comments and likes. That might have features like groups of your interests, events to keep track of, and perhaps even a marketplace for local buying.
