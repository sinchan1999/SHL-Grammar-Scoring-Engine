 So the playground is fenced off bordering the school. I can hear teachers playing, excuse me, I can hear teachers sort of talking amongst themselves while the students are playing. Students are very loud or obnoxious. They can be playing tag, going through the jungle gym, what have you. Sliding down the slide, you know, trying the best to relax after just, oh, what they find is a boring lesson in school. Maybe there's a kid being bullied somewhere too far away and all the teachers are really paying attention because they're too deep into their own complexes, you know. Just other stuff you see at recess. Just the normal things, you know. It's just blacktop with some, Thank you very much for watching.
