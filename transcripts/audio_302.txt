 The best day of my life was my 20th birthday because we celebrated it on the beach that day so regarding that day we had a lot of games and events regarding my birthday so for example we had a game called crack a melon where you spin around with a blindfold and butt in hand and then you need to listen for the commands of your friends so you can crack the melon. So yeah overall it was the super fun experience and the best day of my life.
