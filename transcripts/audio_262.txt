 My goal in life is to have a good work-life balance so I can actually enjoy my life, but also be able to afford things I need in life to be happy. Ultimately, I would love to have a house so I can build equity, however, the market is really stupid at the moment. Interest rates are really high, there is a lot of demand in my area and we're on enough supply. makes me focused on it is the fact that my rent keeps going up every year and I am paying someone else's mortgage, essentially. I would like to have my own house. I am determined to get a house because I keep looking at Zillow and keep looking at houses and put offers on them that ultimately get denied. So I guess it's just gonna be down to persistence in going and saving money. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
