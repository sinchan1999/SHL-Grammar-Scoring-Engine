 the entire place was completely broken it was like something just came in broke everything the water level was up to the hip of that child of 12 years old like the wire was so high it destroyed all the furniture that was on the room everything everywhere the wire just got on all the electronic devices as well So, like, everything was so damaged and broken or shattered, or just simply completely damaged by the water. It's just a chaos. It's so damaged and destroyed and dirty.
