 So, describing the favorite place of mine is Vrindavan. First of all we book our tickets and we go by a train to the Vrindavan. It is a very beautiful place and everyone must have to visit. Vrindavan is the place of Lord Krishna. about local foods or dishes so Lassi which is made up of curd is very famous and I love so much other than that there is no particular time particular time or season a holy is a special season and they play holy for a month. So yeah, this is all about Prentah Manu.
