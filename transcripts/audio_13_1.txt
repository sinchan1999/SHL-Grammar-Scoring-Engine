 My favourite place to visit is at My Nan's. The travel destination is quite long as it takes four hours, but I'm excited because I get to see My Nan. The local foods are probably the ones that she makes. She makes a mean curry, which I love very much. The season that I enjoy most at my nans is probably summer because she lives in a very rural area in a bungalow which is surrounded by greenery, beautiful plants, wonderful garden, lots of different insects, bees, caterpillars, buzzing animals at night like owls. It's a lovely magical place to be.
