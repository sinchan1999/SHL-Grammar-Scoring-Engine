 My favorite holiday destination is spending time at Goa. Goa is my favorite holiday destination because I love beaches and there are many beaches in Goa. Apart from beaches, I love the churches which are there at Goa because they give me peace. And at the beaches I love to spend time because I am a water baby and I love to hang out at places which give me a lot of solace and it is a very nice place to chill and hang out with as it is to the coastal region.
