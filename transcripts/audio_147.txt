 My favorite place to visit is Calcorato. For me, this involves a car trip of several days traveling across the United States, which is part of the experience I would say is just getting there and once you arrive, then you can immediately tell from the air quality how nice it is to be there and how beautiful the nature is and all along the drive heading to Colorado, there are towering mountains on the other side of your car. It's an overwhelming and awe-inspiring experience. A time of day or season that Colorado is especially beautiful, I would say is fall. The leaves on the Aspen trees are all yellows, golds, oranges, reds. If you can get to a state park, I would highly recommend it if you're visiting. Thank you very much for joining us.
