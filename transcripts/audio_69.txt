 The playground looks like it's an open field playground, lots of colours, lots of trees around it. It has three swings, three slides and the popular game among students is the swing the love swinging and the ropes to climb and I'm running around what sounds can you hear in the playground the sounds that you hear the sounds of kids screaming kids shouting students shouting students having fun people climbing up and down.
