 When I go to the market, I always see a bunch of people buying their groceries, their daily, their weekly food, and I hear a bunch of sounds, them chattering in the background, so there's a bunch of noise and always in the supermarket, and in the day it gets very full and the evening is more empty but when I go it's really like really full and there's a bunch of people waiting on the line just buying their food
