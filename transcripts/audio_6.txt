 My favourite hobby is grafting. I love how to let me connect with the nature and see the beauty of the plants growing. All I need are some basic tools like a shouldle, rake and watering can. I enjoy gardening both on my own for quite a reflection and sometimes with friends or family for a fun and a collaborative experience, whether I am digging in the soil alone or sharing the joy of gardening with others, it always brings me a sense of full on happiness. I love to learn. It is very interesting.
