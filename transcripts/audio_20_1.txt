 A goal that I have in life is to one day get married and start a family. I've always wanted to be able to have a loving husband and a beautiful family to come home to. Although I am a movement by myself in life, I've always had desire to do life with someone else. Unfortunately, the challenges are there's not a lot of great men in society. Some of them are either married, taken or aren't ready for commitment. That's the biggest challenge there is. Unfortunately, you know, marriage takes to the tingle, and I would need someone to get married to. What motivates me is to definitely put my best foot forward, try online dating, friend referrals, and really put myself out there. I also go to happy hours, speed dating, and put references out to friends. Can't hurt to try, however, definitely. I'll get married one day. It's definitely a solid goal of mine. Thank you very much.
