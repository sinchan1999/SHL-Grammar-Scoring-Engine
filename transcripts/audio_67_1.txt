 Today I was at the Farmer's Market in Four Ways and it's basically a market for people who sell fresh produce and homemade goods, organic products and products that they have made with their own hands. You hear a lot of kids, you hear a lot of grown people, young people and you basically here, people having fun, having conversations. You hear delivery trucks going in and out, people passing with cars, and excuse me, excuse me, every few minutes. In the morning, it's quite crowded and it's a bit of a stampede because everybody wants the fresh food, but As the hours pass, people start to become less.
