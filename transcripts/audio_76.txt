 My goal in life is to have basic things that I can afford, basic human needs such as housing, The use of transportation could help a family. What changes me is the fear that if I don't work hard, I may not get this visitation. And the fear of feeling keeps me motivated to keep on going because this life is very hard to actually live and survive in.
