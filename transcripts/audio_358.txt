 The smart phone application that I use to most is TikTok. Because TikTok is helping me to gain followers and also entertainment. In TikTok also, I can buy things that I need for everyday use. And TikTok is my favorite application because I can't find anything there. It's like a Google, but if you're looking for an answer for all your questions, you can see it with videos and most of the tiktokers there, they are providing the good answer for most of the questions that I'm looking for.
