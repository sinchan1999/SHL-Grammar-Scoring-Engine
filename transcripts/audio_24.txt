 I am describing the best day of my life. The best day of my life was when the 12th result came. Before the 12th result came, the corona COVID-19 was present and lockdown was gone for 1 year. So all the exams of 12th and 10th were cancelled by the CBSE and Indian government. So, I was studying in the Rice and Board Government College and I scored 98.4% in my 12th class. So, that day was my best day of my life and I also got good college, Lovely Professional University with 50% scholarship because of that 12th percentage. So, this was my best day.
