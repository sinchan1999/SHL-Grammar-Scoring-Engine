 So the most applications or the application that I use the most is probably YouTube right now. It's a platform that you can watch videos. I usually watch two people PewDiePie and MrBeast. PewDiePie is, it was a gaming content creator before but right now because he's married, he has a kid. He's transitioned to family blogs and stuff like that. On the other hand, MrBeast has a lot of money, and he used that money to entertain people. Like me, you know.
