 My topic is describe the scene of a hospital. In my experience, I've been in a hospital before and what I have noticed is there are a lot of people standing in line and there are some waiting for the doctor and some patient who are going to have their procedure. Like, they will have a surgery and it's a very busy environment because some patients have a critical illness and it's not easy to be in a hospital.
