 So one of the best days of my life was the day I gave birth. It was a very intense, difficult experience, but a most rewarding day. What made this special was the fact that I could see her and she looked so pretty. And whenever I feel about this day, I feel like I haven't had any other day like this. The feeling of, you know, it was overwhelming and it was a blessing.
