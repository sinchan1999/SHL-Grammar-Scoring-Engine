 My favourite place to visit are the beaches in Cornwall in the United Kingdom. It's actually where I grew up but I no longer live there so now I really enjoy visiting Cornwall as a tourist. You have to take a long car journey from where I live to get there with some beautiful sights of the English countryside along the way. My favourite food to eat in Cornwall is Cornish pasties, which are pastries filled with meat and vegetables, as well as cream teas which are scones filled with clotted cream and jam. I really enjoy summer evenings at Cornish beaches, particularly eating dinner on the beach after a few hours of swimming in the ocean and talking with my friends and family.
