 My favorite piece of this book is called, is Regina. I love to use Regina because I do think I have animals, I get to see them. The rabbits, the horses, all the animals, different kinds of animals. even domestic animals, the lions, the cats, the dogs, the monkeys. Well, the place, the kind of food I like the most in the world, especially quads, is the banana. Why? Because I actually love to eat that particular food. And I get the shape of the monkeys too, and I will never be purchased a pound, I won't be grabbed that well. There is a particular time, or season, that is. Mostly, I enjoy this whenever it's holiday time, because everyone, the kids will get it.
