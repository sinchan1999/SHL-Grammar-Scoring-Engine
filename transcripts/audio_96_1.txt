 My favorite fictional character is Harry Moon Granger from the Henry Potter series. She is smart, resourceful and always stands up for what she believes in. And another favorite character is Attisha Finns from Toothilia, Mothwind Bride. He embodies integrity and moral courage. He embodies integrity and moral courage teaching important lessons about justice and empathy. That's all.
