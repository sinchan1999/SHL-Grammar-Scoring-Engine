 Hello, it was a while seeing the school playground is bringing back the memories of my school days. When I was a kid, I used to play there on the school playground with my friends and my childhood friends. It's not a wonderful feeling. Cannot express the feelings of us grateful I am playing with the ground. Each time we went to the ground to play a lot of games like cricket, football, ice and water, anything. I cannot express the meanings or the playground means to me.
