 My goal is I want to earn sufficient and enough money for me and my family and to clear all the loans. Actually we have constructed a house so far that there is so much home loan is there. So to clear that loan I want to earn money. So, my goal is to earn sufficient money for my family and this goal is important for me to clear all my debuts. So, to achieve this goal, I am working so much hard on academics and training and placements. So, I will stay focused in the achievement of the goal. My motivation is my family only because my mother, father and brother helps me to stay focused in achieving my goal. Thank you.
