 So in a train station I can describe the scene people or individuals who are falling in line for the T-CAT and some of those were trying to get inside the station and the others were waiting for the train to arrive. It is a busy day since it is workday so people are walking fast minding their own business and amidst of those business of the station there are still there are people who will guide you through your way or your destination
