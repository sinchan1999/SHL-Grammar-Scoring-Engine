 The topic is describe your stay at a resort. So when I have reached the resort with my family, it was during the summer, so it's very hot and sweaty. But after reaching the resort, the weather is so pleasant because of its beautiful ambience around around and the food they serve is truly loveable and they have different kinds of cuisines and the service they made is also very good and they also have the private clubs which we can enjoy ourselves and it is nearby the beach so we spend more time in the beach with my family.
