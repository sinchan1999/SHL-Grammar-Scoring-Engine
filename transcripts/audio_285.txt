 One of my favorite holiday destinations in a small town, it has beautiful sandy location where you can relax under the sun. The water is clear and is perfect for swimming. The location is filled with charming shops and local restaurants serving with fresh foods. In the evenings you can stroll along the location enjoying the sea breeze and the sound of waves. There are also copy spots or cozy spots to watch the sunset and make it definitely make it a peaceful getaway. The laid back atmosphere and stunning views create the perfect escape from everyday life.
