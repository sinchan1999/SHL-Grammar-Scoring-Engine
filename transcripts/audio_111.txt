 smoothing effect. Besides this, I also have hobbies such as reading comic books, painting, writing narrative stories and maintaining a scrapbook. These activities make me happy and enhance my hidden qualities. Writing and reading boosts my imagination. Along with these activities, I participate in gardening in my leisure time because I love to plant new and colorful flowers. Moreover, I like dancing and singing, these are the activities I often do whenever I find time. After completing my studies and homework, I do participate in singing and dancing competitions as well. Because I like to sing and dance, my teachers and parents always appreciate and encourage me to pursue my hobbies. Every human being on the earth is unique, not only in terms of appearance.
