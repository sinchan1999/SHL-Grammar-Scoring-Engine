 I'm not much of a traveler, so this is going to be a bit of a lacking answer. So typically, because I'm more of a stay-at-home sort of person, an introvert, I don't go out much, but I do in particular enjoy walking, basically, toward the neighborhood and such. And there is one particular route that I particularly enjoy once you get past a few blocks. Is one of the few places here that's left that's not been developed. So it's still essentially bushland to a certain degree. You go past some buildings and down a small slope and on your left you'll have what is essentially left over farmland and such and I'm taking too long to explain this. You go down the road, there's more bushland, there's a lot of trees and such, and it has some traffic, it's a generous amount.
