 Actually, the most I use it to enjoy is like practicing coding. I really like the coding because that gives you some much confidence in you like you can do it and you can be able to think and give the answer and give the solution in a most appropriate way. coding is my best hobby I use to spend so much amount of time on it like after going to college most of the time I spend on coding it is my biggest happiness because the coding is really important for the placement and everything so I really like it so much yeah I take some help from the from my friends as as well as mentors that queued me and if confidence to build more enthusiastic or more interesting we can go better depth.
