 The hobby that I enjoy the most is painting. Painting brings such a calm and relaxing experience for me and it helps me advance my creativity. The tools that I need for painting are the canvas, the colors, the paint brushes, the color mixing tools and I love enjoying painting on my own but I also love it with my children because it brings out the creativity and also helps me realize what kind of things.
