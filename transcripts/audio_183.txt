 When we got to the resort, we went straight to the parking and we saw the horrible lines there were in order to do the checking. We got to the check and we waited like 30 minutes in order to do our checking and we were finally given the key to our room. We couldn't find the room and we got lost in the way there but we finally got there and I couldn't wait to get to the pool and the beautiful view we got from the beach and the pool from our room was perfect. I was very hungry, so I went to the pool for a few minutes and then I went straight to eat at the buffet.
