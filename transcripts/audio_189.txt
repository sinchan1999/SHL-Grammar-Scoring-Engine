 Habbies are typically more focused on activities that a person pursues in their freedom. My hobby is playing ukulele and sometimes I'm watching some k-dramas. The things that I use for my hobby is a thing that called ukulele and of course a cell phone. I enjoy practicing ukulele and discovering the new chords. I enjoy playing ukulele with others because we create bond with each other and create some new memories.
