 The best thing in my life is the first time when I went to college, the first day of my college I entered to the college after completing my schooling, the subject I have chosen is completely opposite to my wish because I like studying medicine but I haven't performed my entrance well so I got one I got to study engineering which is the most hated subject my way by me but the first day I went to the college the first time we saw my favorite professor he was so handsome I admired him I liked him when When he talks, when he teaches, when he speaks with others, when he laughs, when he smiles, I love this.
