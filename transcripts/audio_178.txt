 Okay, so my most favorite place to visit is Greece, especially this particular place called Porto Hjeli, and it's my favorite destination. I go there, I usually would take the airplane from New York, but we have to make a stop in Athens, where I see a lot of friends that I have there. And then I go there to meet my family and my friends to Porto Heli. The local dishes are mostly seafood, just grilled, or the suvlaiki, that's my favorite one and it's the first thing, because I miss it here, it's not the same taste when I go there. And I always visit in the summer so I can go to the beach as well, because they have very, very, very good and beautiful beaches.
