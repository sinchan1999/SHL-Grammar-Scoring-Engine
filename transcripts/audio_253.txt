 My favorite sport will be probably swimming because that is the first sport I learned because my mom wanted me to learn how to swim and just in case of any emergency because if you are in any case flying and the God forbid the plane is crashing in the middle of the ocean and you have to swim or you're maybe in a boat and the boat is about to sink in and you have to swim too so it's like a really necessary sport swimming I really like it and I think it's really refreshing it's really healthy as well I really like swimming
