 My hobby is to enjoy every moment of the life, whatever it may be, it may be sad, happy or something else, every moment is precious for us, so we need to enjoy every moment in our life, whatever it may be the result, we should not think on result, we should think on process how the process is going on then it will automatically give you a smile on our face and that is my ultimate goal not thinking of too much of result what will happen now tomorrow day after tomorrow no favorite hobby is to enjoy the every moment of life having smile on my face. That's it.
