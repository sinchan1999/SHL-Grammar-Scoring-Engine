 My favorite holiday season happened in last year and we, me and my family go there. We've been planning for a long time to go that place and it's about 145 km away from my home and that place is called Munnar which is a very heaven on earth place to visit and there is lot of place to visit moonar and we we specifically go away place called vatavada and vatavada is kind of a forest area which is really amazing and we we go there in the monsoon season and it's really amazing to visit that place it's a great experience
