 One of my best hobby, one of my favorite hobby that I enjoy the most is I love playing football. I love playing football. Whenever I play football, I used to like play football with my colleagues, my friends. Whenever I play football, I feel this is enjoying me and I feel like I'm positively, positively active. and one of the tools that I use that for training is I used to like watch YouTube videos. I used to watch videos of Mahayyid of Cristiano Ronaldo. I see the way he does his skills, the way he does his skills, the way he composes himself. I learned a lot from him and I do also practice. Sometimes I practice on my own, sometimes I practice with my colleagues, with my friends, whether I would like to train ourselves or the football matches we used to watch, all the things we learned from there, we put it into practice.
