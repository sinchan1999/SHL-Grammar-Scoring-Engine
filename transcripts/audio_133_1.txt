 For me, best friend is a partner or buddy, someone you can talk about. Also, having a best friend is one of the best things you can experience as a person because you can talk about experience, knowledge, and everything about your experience every day. And for me, having a best friend is one of the most best things that happen in my life. Just like my best friend in high school, they're so very supported. Ako na things I do, especially in my career, they're always supporting me to do my best.
