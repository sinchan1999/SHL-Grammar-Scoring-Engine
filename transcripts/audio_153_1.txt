 My favorite movie is really motivational. It actually allows me to really hope something good about life and also to dream something bigger for me, for my family, and for society as well. So it actually allows me to be better, to actually experience life as it is, to be more present in the moment, and to be more grateful to whatever that I actually have at the moment. To not give up in life, to not give up on oneself, and to love as deeply as one could ever love. Because life is actually meant for living and it's actually meant to be like a happy one.
