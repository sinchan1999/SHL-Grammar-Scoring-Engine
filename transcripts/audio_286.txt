 the description of the scene of a flood I can imagine that it's a lot of trash that's stuck somewhere because we don't put the garbage on its place and we should avoid this we have to put the trash on his place so we don't get floods during rainy days or in the winter. This is something that we should be able to do and we should take care of the earth.
