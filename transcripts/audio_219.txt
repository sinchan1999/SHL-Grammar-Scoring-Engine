 so usually an airport is crowded because there's a lot of people going from one place to another some of them in a hurry to catch their flight you can see some screens where you can check your flight status and there are some counters with employees from the airlines that work there that are supposed to help you and for you to check in and there are also some security checkpoints where you have to be checked and your luggage as well and also some stores you can buy from and you can take whatever you purchase to your destination.
