 When walking through the airport, you can see big windows as you walk through the gates, which are numbered A, B, C, 1 to 100. You can see through the windows the planes that are flying away and flying into the airport. You can walk past all the duty-free stores and buy as many souvenirs as you want, and as many snacks as you want to eat on the plane. Once you get to your gate you can sit down on the chairs and enjoy some time before your plane takes off and they call your name.
