 My goal was to become a software user here. This is my lifetime goal because this makes me inspired by Suda Murti, she was the founder of Infosys. She makes me very inspiring, like she is way of teaching and working with the same life and how to deal with families along with the colleagues and yeah this is very really appreciating and inspiring personality in my life. This makes me I want to become like like her and like leading like she are leading their life and the challenges to become this gore is yeah the coding to solve a different type of problems is very difficult and not too easy to solve.
