 So, Japan is really the favorite place that I really want to visit soon. They are not only popular for their tourist attraction, but they are also very popular for their local foods. And one of the dishes that I really, really love to try when I go there is the ramen. So, unlike the ramen here in our country, it is very much different from the ramen that are made. originaly from the local japanese people there and i do really really love to witness also personally the sakura folding on the sakura trees especially on the spring season they are the most uh very popular season in japan
