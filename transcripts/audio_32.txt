 What I remember is the best day of my life is when I got hired in a PPO industry, it's my first time because I am a fresh graduate in senior high school and I met a lot of friends and now I am independent that I can provide to my family because I am a breadwinner and I'm grateful that I got hard from my first job experience which is in a call center. I'm grateful for that.
