 A school playground, it's one of the safest places that children are supposed to be. Security is supposed to be more on that side because most of the time they spend their time being on the playground. Anything can happen there and there's no one who would be able to take care of them. So I believe that a lot of security should be provided for the children in order for them to be safe enough and to be guided whenever there's a situation that will need a grown-up person's help.
