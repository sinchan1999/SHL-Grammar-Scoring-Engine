 Hello, thanks for the answer. I'm going to talk about the school playground that I had. When I was a little child, I really enjoyed going to school. Basically, because on the playground, we practiced a lot of sports, such as soccer, volleyball, basketball. It It was a beautiful time, I remember that I had a lot of friends, nowadays everything has changed, so I wish everything could be like it used to be before, nowadays everybody is not interested in playing the sport no more.
