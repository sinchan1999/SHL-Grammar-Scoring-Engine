 My favorite place to visit is my local cinema, it is close to my house so I don't take any vehicle there, I work there, I order a popcorn or whatever drink I need and then I sit and watch the movie playing in the cinema. The reason I love this place is because I get to be among the first set of people to watch a movie and not come to an online platform like Twitter already and see information about the movie when I have them.
