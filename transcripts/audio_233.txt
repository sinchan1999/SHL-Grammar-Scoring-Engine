 The school playground is a fun place, kids run and play there, they laugh and shout. Some climb on the tall things, others slide down fast. There are swings that go high up, kids talk and share secrets. It's like a busy behave with lot of noises and happy faces. The grass is green and soft. When the school bag brings, everyone slowly goes back to their classrooms.
