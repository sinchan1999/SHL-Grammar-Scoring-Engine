 The best day of my life was when I entered a lottery game and I won. I wasn't expecting to win but I won anyway. I was able to win a lot of money, not too much money but at least money that I was able to buy some few things that I needed at that time. So I was so happy, I was overjoyed. Now when I think about that day, I'll smile and be thinking, oh, that was a good day and She is there for me. It makes me so happy.
