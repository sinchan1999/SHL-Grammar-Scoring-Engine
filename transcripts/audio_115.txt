 I truly want to have one life goal, and that is not to die poor. While people may say that money does not buy happiness, or cannot buy happiness, money can essentially buy or at the very least take care of a lot of life's issues. Instead, issues will bring down your happiness. As such, I made it my goal in life to essentially accumulate as much wealth as possible. I know you for myself also for my family. The thought of growing old and yet be dependent on government programs as such far as me. Learn all for my family whom I cannot say are very dependable. As such, I will try my best in order to accumulate wealth that can essentially take care of all of us throughout our ages up until our Hopefully, time to demise.
