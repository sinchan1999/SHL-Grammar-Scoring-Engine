 My favorite place in the world to visit, at least from those that I've been, is New Orleans, Louisiana. It's a place that is just very near to my heart. My mom would always take me there as I was growing up. These are just between a vacation spot, you know, without my brother or sister. And it was just a magical place of fun, the kind that they wouldn't appreciate, you know. I love gumbo, it's one of my favorite foods, they're crawfish, and I'm caging through and through, you know. And Mardi Gras is the magical time to visit the city.
