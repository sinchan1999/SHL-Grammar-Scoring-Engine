 So the playground in my mind has a sand floor, it's in front of the school and it's very colourful, it's got lots of different play areas, it's got trees lined around it, the children are playing tad or hide and seek or climbing on the climbing frame or playing on the swings. And I think I can hear children screaming and laughing together. The teachers might be chatting on one side or calling out to some of the kids. I think it would just be quite a lively and loud scene.
