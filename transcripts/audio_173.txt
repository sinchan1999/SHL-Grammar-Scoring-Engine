 My favorite place to visit would be Japan, because well, I'm really interested in their culture. I'm really into all Japanese stuff like anime, their history, etc. So that's why that would be my favorite place to visit. the food that I would like to try, I would like to try the yoshas, I would like to try the cakes that they sell that have different flavors mainly for fruits and the season that I would like to go is during the cherry seasons when all the trees have like those pink leaves so I think I think that's really cool.
