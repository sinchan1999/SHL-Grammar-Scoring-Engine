 Let's see. I'm at Eastern Market. The place is crowded. They're selling everything from clothing to jewelry to shoes. There's street vendors here. They're selling hot dogs, hamburgers, sliders, fish sandwiches, Mexican food, and Chinese food. It's pretty loud here so I have delay talk over the mic and in the morning it's a pretty lax crowd mostly old people looking for some great deals and then as it transitions into the evening you get more of the urban crowd single moms kids teenagers and then by night you get the rowdy a bunch the people coming home from the bar who just want to eat some of this delicious street food I don't know I would say that the Eastern market is a very good market and you should come in when you get the chance.
