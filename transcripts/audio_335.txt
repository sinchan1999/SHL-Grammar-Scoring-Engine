 My favourite hobby is gardening, because in gardening you get a bit close to what nature and you get to understand how nature really works. You will get to understand what is the use of peasants, because you are gardening and feeding the plant and watering it, but it will bloom only in spring season, but you have to water it in each and every day of the year. you will get the patience by watching it and by daily practicing your gardening practices. And I practice it on my own only because it is a time where there's no one between me and the nature. So it's a great time for me to spend with the nature because I like the greenery most and I like the sound of birds and butterflies so I like it the most and you should also try it. Thank you very much for watching.
