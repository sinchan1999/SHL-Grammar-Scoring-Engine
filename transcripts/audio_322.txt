 My favorite place is Manman Bandala where the Goddess Hanuman is there. It's a traveling from the villages and reaching the destination upon the hill. The local foods are famous like dosas and dosas. There is a particular season to visit that place is Antikamasam, where all people early morning, woke up and visit this place to pray the Lord Hanuman. This is my favorite place to visit.
