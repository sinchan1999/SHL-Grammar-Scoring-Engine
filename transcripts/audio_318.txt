 we're first of all to describe my stay in Arizona I need to mention that I was in Santa Marta the hotel was so so clean and the staff was very patient with every concern I had during my during my stance also the food was amazing because they have four different restaurants for different countries it was Italian, Mexican, Colombian, and Mediterranean food, so every dish was really really nice. Also they were different places to meet with your family and with your friends.
