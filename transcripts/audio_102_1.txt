 My favorite place to visit has always been renting a cabin in southern Indiana or Kentucky. The reason that it's my favorite is because it's very secluded, surrounded by woods. There's a lot of nature around you. It's usually about a 3 to 6 hour drive depending on where the cabin is that I'm visiting. we will always go out to dinner to different places there's nothing specific that we go to out there to eat but we do enjoy the more southern food that's out there and the best season to go is spring or early summer so that way it's not too hot or not too cold it's usually the perfect amount of warmth with a breeze outside. Thank you very much for watching.
