 In a flood, when I arrive, I see houses submerged under the cool water, fast-moving floodwaters. The streets look like rivers with cars and puds trunks. Emerging sirens, rescuing people with boats, residents stands on foot-suits and balconies. There are others that have to evacuate their houses with their pets and they have to go go to a safer place with their things, carrying up medical supplies and food and clothes. The water have broken branches, brooded trees and even garbage. The heuristic with the smell of gasoline and damp ed and we only see the troops of threes and the rocks.
