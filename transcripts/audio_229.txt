 My favorite hobby is cricket. I like to play cricket with my friends and with my friends only. I used to play cricket in my childhood days when it was about 10th standard up to 10th standard only. Nowadays I didn't want to play cricket because all my friends are very busy with their academics and all other teams. And I enjoy very much to play because it has very ups and downs in cricket and very happiness and sadness with my friends and all other things. Is there anything to play? We use bat and ball and wickets and all other things. Mainly we use bat and ball and we enjoy to practice, we practice cricket very honestly. and we learn the cricket by watching the cricket only. I like the cricket very most.
