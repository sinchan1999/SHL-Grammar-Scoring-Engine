 Oh my god, well, so the playground looks vivid and you see children running around. Sometimes you'll see the kids playing tag or duck duck goose. Other times they will play hopscotch. Some children play in groups, while others play alone, and most of the day they will play outside, but when the weather doesn't allow it, they will play inside. And the school playground, you hear a lot of shouting, laughing, screaming, and overall just children having fun making all sorts of imaginative sounds. That's what you end up hearing.
