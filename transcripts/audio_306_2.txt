 The airport is buzzing with activity as people are screaming around like lugging suitcases and looking at departure boats. So when I was on the airport I saw a mother was running towards his son with a sandal in his hand as maybe she was very angry with him. So she started beating him and I was laughing and other people were also staring at them what they are doing. So this was a very hilarious incident for me and it was shocking as well for some others.
