 The playground looks like a beautiful magical book where you can have all the fun and activities. You have the sandbox which everyone is there playing and doing some sandcastles and playing with their trucks, imaginary work, carrying on the sand and it sounds amazing. Actually, I enjoy a lot meeting other students from other colleges, slash schools, which they go for the same playground. Actually, it's not on my school, but it's on a public space, which we all go and around. We can hear all the cars and birds and people walking around and talking about it, which is very nice and very wonderful. Today is a very nice day and I can hear the birds singing through this lovely day which is nice for me and my friends to live this life.
