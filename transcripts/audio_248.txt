 My topic is about to describe the best day of my life and the best day of my life is when I met my best friend and I couldn't say his name but he is such an understanding person and he is such an matured person and in every situation he understands me so well and without him I think my life wouldn't be like this and it would have so many changes without him him and I would have missed someone who is so close to me and so so who who understands me so well other than anyone and I think that's the day which I have met him and without the day without meeting him it will be so horrible that life was for me and he changed it so much in my life and yes the days are very special for me
