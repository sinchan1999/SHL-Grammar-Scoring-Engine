 My favorite place to travel is to Ocean City, Maryland. I don't live far from there, so I get in the car and then I just drive an hour and once I'm over the bridge to Ocean Pines, I am in Ocean City. The local foods that I like in Ocean City are the Thrasher Fries, which is pretty much which is just local, it's just in that one place, the Thrasher's Company. Dipping Dots, which you can also get on the Boer Walk and pretty much anything on the Boer Walk. And there's one place that serves these burgers, I forget the name of it, but it's also on the Boer Walk. And I like to go there, and you can go there in the summer because there's a lot of people there, and you can also go in the winter where there is a lot of, there's festival of lights.
