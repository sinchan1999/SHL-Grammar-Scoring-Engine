 I was staying at the Long Pool Resort here in Chihuahua, Mexico and they have really nice views. There's lots of people staying from around the world and they have great food and breakfast. There is a lot of great weather and they have pretty big rooms. They have nice lining and as well they have carpet on the floors. People here are really happy with the service because it is really good. People taking care of the cleanliness of the place are really great in their jobs. The place is always really clean. I really love this resort.
