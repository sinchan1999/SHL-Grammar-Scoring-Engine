 My favorite travel experience in Malaysia is when I'm going to visit Hokkaido Japan. I really love the scenery and the local food they have, they have a really good beer and milk product that produce locally in their area and it has a really nice quality. yeah I think the quality is really high especially the dairy products it's different from what I can find in my country yeah I like their food like ramen and especially I remember when I'm eating curry the Hokkaido curry it really gives a memory in my place and actually I think it's really nice Yeah, a bit lucky.
