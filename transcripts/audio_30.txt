 a favorite place for me to visit is Seoul, South Korea. I've been there many times but I never get bored of it. I love to go there especially in the spring or autumn when the weather is just perfect, not too hot and not too cold. When I go, I really like to go to various cafes they have a really nice cafe culture with lots of trendy and stylish cafes I like to cafe hop around to different new coffee shops that I looked up on Instagram or other social networks another thing I really love to do is go up a mountain solely surrounded by various mountains and go up a mountain at sunset when the evening light is just perfect to look out over the city.
