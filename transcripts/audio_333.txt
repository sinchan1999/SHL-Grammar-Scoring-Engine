 I love going to the beach, the beach in Costa Rica. It's one of my favorite places to travel to. Although it is not a white sand beach, the water is fairly calm and it is always warm. There are also food stations scattered around the beach which makes it easy to spend all day there. The people are friendly and there's always something to do. It is also very safe. If you want to, you can explore the beach and see all different types of wildlife including birds and cage-linked crocodiles. There are also smaller beaches that are cove-like beaches. You have to hike through the woods to get to them, but it's like a little secret journey. Realistically, I would try to go to different beaches every day while I'm in Costa Rica because they all have a different experience. Some beaches are allowed and crowded or other secluded and quiet.
