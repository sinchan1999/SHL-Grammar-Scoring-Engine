 The airport is buzzing with activity as people scream around like lugging suitcases and looking at departure boats. So when I was on the airport I saw a mother was running towards his son with a sandal in his hand as maybe she was very angry with him so she started beating him. I was laughing and other people also was staring at them what they are doing. So this was a very hilarious incident for me and it was shocking as well for some others.
