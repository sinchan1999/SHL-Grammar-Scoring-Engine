 You can hear a crowded market before you can see it. The near the cacophony of noises, the clenium of change, the ups and downs, as people rifle through their bags, trying to figure out which is the best peak to the bunch. Markets are big. Markets continue to be tight, with many people passing through each other like sardines, dreams, hoping to find the next best deal, you have people selling fruit, people selling produce that their own chickens made, you have people selling their own layers as though they are also somehow artisanal. In the morning you can have vendors coming in restocking as it gets to a war throughout the day. around 3 p.m., 4 p.m., we're slowly dying down.
