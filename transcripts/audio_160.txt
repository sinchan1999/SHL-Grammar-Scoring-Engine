 When I was a kid, I liked to go with my friends to the store and purchase some food, some snacks to chill a little bit in the playground. I remember that we played football a lot. a lot and in other games like basketball and criminals and police, all that games that we play at the school when we are, when we, when all of us are a kid. So that's the only rumor that I have.
