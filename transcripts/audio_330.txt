 my most favorite hobby of all times it's dancing any kind of dancing but particularly I've been a contemporary dancer for 15 years of my life but I also like dancing sumba or salsa that's very energizing what I love the most is is actually my mood improvement. I just feel very much alive every time that I dance. And I just feel free, very free. For dancing, usually I don't need anything in particular. In any case, just a good pair of shoes that are comfortable for moving around. And I actually enjoy both things, either dancing by myself and for myself, but also with others and in groups.
