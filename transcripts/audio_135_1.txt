 The best day of my life was when I achieved a long-held goal of mine. It was a day filled with joy, pride and sense of accomplishment. I had worked incredibly hard to teach this milestone and finally achieving it was incredibly fulfilling. If I hadn't experienced this best day, my life wouldn't be different. My life will be different in many ways. I might not have gained the confidence and belief in myself that comes from achieving a challenging goal. It also taught me the value of perseverance and hard work, which had since influenced many aspects of life. So my best day was when I got an award, when I was in fifth class and I got the award in Olympics. It was my first time I received some medal in my school life time and it was an undescribable movement for me. It nearly was something that I wasn't expecting but the day was amazing.
