 They come loaded with produce of the season such as cotton, grain, oil, seeds, vegetables, etc. Whenever I visit a market, I find a hawker shouting loudly to sell their goods. They try to attract the people by several lame singing songs and the best part is satisfaction for the customer is by buying the things at the minimum cost, makes them happy. Clouder markets seen change throughout the day, at the evening times there will be shops will be filled with the crowd, sometimes people will be buying the fruits, vegetables, spinach all those things. A busy marketplace is full of people and is always bustling with activity.
